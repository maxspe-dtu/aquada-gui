Welcome to the README for AQUADA-GUI.

This program is a graphical user interface (GUI) for AQUADA (Automated quantification of damages in composite wind turbine blades). It allows for users to analyze their thermal images by croping, creating binary damages masks, and quantifying the damage growth. 

============
Installation
============

AQUADA GUI is combined with python and all the necessary packages into one application. This consists of the 'aquada-gui' folder, whiich contains many files. These are listed below, but the one to focus on is 'aquada-gui.exe'. To run the GUI, simply click on this file, and it will run. To find this file more easily, you can create a shortcut to it by right clicking on 'aquada-gui.exe'. This shortcut can then be kept in a convenient location.

Important Notes
============
This program will ONLY work with a Windows operating system. Video files must be in .wmv format, and images must be .png. 
Thermography video files should also be in a color pallette where lighter colors are hotter, in order to generate meaningful results.
